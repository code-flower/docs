CLIENT


SERVER
  - try to break the server with weird urls and such
  - aborting should kill the process immediately rather than waiting until the end and then deleting

BUILD/DEPLOY
  - deploy to aws w/codedeploy, S3, Elastic Beanstalk

CHROME EXTENSION
  - pros
    - button in browser makes access easy
    - the static files are saved in the user's harddrive
      - so no strain on the server from serving those files
      - and the app will work offline
    - don't have to worry about cross-browser issues
    - no real need to minify stuff for performance reasons
  - cons
    - harder to automate the deployment of new versions
      - but check out https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/using_webstore_api
    - user has to install the app on the chrome store


GIT FUNCTIONALITY
  - look at visualizing git history
